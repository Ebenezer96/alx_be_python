# daily_reminder.py
# A program that reminds the user of a single priority task using match case, conditionals, and loops.

# Prompt user for task details
task = input("Enter your task: ")
priority = input("Priority (high/medium/low): ").lower()
time_bound = input("Is it time-bound? (yes/no): ").lower()

# Match Case for priority handling
match priority:
    case "high":
        reminder = f"'{task}' is a high priority task"
    case "medium":
        reminder = f"'{task}' is a medium priority task"
    case "low":
        reminder = f"'{task}' is a low priority task"
    case _:
        reminder = f"'{task}' has an unspecified priority level"

# Add time-sensitivity condition
if time_bound == "yes":
    reminder += " that requires immediate attention today!"
else:
    reminder = "Note: " + reminder + ". Consider completing it when you have free time."

# Final reminder message
print("\nReminder:", reminder)
